C Data Types
============

Data types specify the type of data a variable can hold. They determine the size, range, and operations that can be performed on the data.

1. Basic (Primitive) Data Types
-------------------------------
- int: Integer numbers
  - Size: Usually 2 or 4 bytes (16 or 32 bits, depends on system)
  - Range: -32,768 to 32,767 (16-bit), -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 (32-bit)
- float: Single-precision floating-point
  - Size: 4 bytes (32 bits)
  - Range: ~1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38 (6-7 decimal digits)
- double: Double-precision floating-point
  - Size: 8 bytes (64 bits)
  - Range: ~2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308 (15 decimal digits)
- char: Single character
  - Size: 1 byte (8 bits)
  - Range: -128 to 127 (signed), 0 to 255 (unsigned)

2. Derived Data Types
---------------------
- Array
- Pointer
- Structure (struct)
- Union
- Enumeration (enum)

Type Modifiers:
---------------
- signed, unsigned, short, long
  - Example: unsigned int, long double

Crucial Points:
---------------
- The size of data types may vary depending on the compiler and architecture.
- Use sizeof(type) to determine the size on your system.
- Choosing the right data type is important for memory efficiency and correctness.

Functions of Data Types:
------------------------
- Define the nature of data stored.
- Determine the operations allowed on the data.
- Help the compiler allocate appropriate memory.
